### What is stored on BusChecker servers
Nothing.
### What may be stored on 3rd-party servers
Any stop code or route number that you request through the app.
### What is stored locally
Any stop code, route number and name that you added. Any other setting is also stored on your device.
### Clear data
If you uninstall BusChecker, all data, except the one that may be stored on 3rd-party servers (the transport companies) will be erased.
## I don't trust you!
Fine. If you have the knowledge to do so, you can go check the code of the app [here](https://github.com/nin0-dev/BusChecker). You will see that all of my claims are true.
